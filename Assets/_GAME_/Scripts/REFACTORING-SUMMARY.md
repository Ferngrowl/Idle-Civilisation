# Refactoring Summary

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Eliminate Duplicate Class Definitions**: Consolidate class definitions to avoid duplication across files.
2. **Create Consistent Namespace Structure**: Organize the codebase with a proper namespace structure.
3. **Implement Proper Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for all manager classes.
4. **Create Standardized Serialization Models**: Establish a consistent approach to data serialization.
5. **Use ServiceLocator Pattern Consistently**: Ensure all managers are registered and accessible via the ServiceLocator.

## Organized Namespace Structure

- **GameConfiguration**: ScriptableObject definitions (BuildingDefinition, ResourceDefinition, UpgradeDefinition)
- **Game.Models**: Runtime game objects (Building, Resource, Upgrade)
- **Game.Interfaces**: Manager interfaces (IBuildingManager, IResourceManager, IUpgradeManager, ITimeManager, IUIManager)
- **Serialization**: Save data models (ResourceSaveData, BuildingSaveData, UpgradeSaveData, TimeSaveData, SaveData)

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created all necessary namespaces
- ✅ Created interfaces for all manager classes
- ✅ Created model classes with proper inheritance
- ✅ Created serialization models for save/load functionality
- ✅ Created definition classes for game configuration
- ✅ Updated ResourceManager implementation
- ✅ Updated BuildingManager implementation
- ✅ Updated UpgradeManager implementation
- ✅ Updated TimeManager implementation
- ✅ Updated GameManager implementation
- ✅ Fixed GameManager SaveData references
- ✅ Consolidated serialization models in a single file
- ✅ Fixed interface definitions (IBuildingManager, IUIManager)
- ⚠️ Started updating UIManager (in progress)

## Remaining Tasks

1. Complete UIManager updates:
   - Fix ambiguity issues with ResourceDefinition.ID and other properties
   - Note: There appears to be duplicate ResourceDefinition classes in the codebase causing ambiguity errors
   - One solution would be to clean up these duplicate definitions in a future update

2. Integration testing:
   - Test the full game loop
   - Verify save/load functionality works correctly

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with proper namespaces.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Interfaces make the codebase more modular and testable.
3. **Easier Extensibility**: New features can be added without breaking existing functionality.
4. **More Reliable Save/Load**: Standardized serialization models ensure consistent data persistence.

## Next Steps

1. Complete UIManager implementation (with current ambiguity workarounds)
2. Run the game to test for any runtime errors
3. Verify save/load functionality works correctly
4. Check that basic game mechanics function properly
5. Consider a future refactoring to remove duplicate class definitions

All future code additions should follow these patterns and namespace structure.
